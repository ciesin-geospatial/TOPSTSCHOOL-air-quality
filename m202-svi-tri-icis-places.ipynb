        "An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of protocols, tools, and definitions that enable different software applications to communicate with each other. It acts as an intermediary, allowing one application to request specific data or actions from another application or service without needing access to its entire codebase. APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information, typically through specific *endpoints* (URLs) that accept requests and return responses in standardized formats like JSON. They are crucial for integrating external services, accessing databases, and enabling communication between different parts of larger open science software systems.\n",

        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "In many urban areas, air quality issues disproportionately affect low-income communities and communities of color [@tessum2021]. This disparity is a key focus of environmental justice efforts. In cities like Detroit, Chicago, and Cleveland industrial facilities, highways, and other pollution sources are often concentrated in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Detroit has a history of industrial pollution and is working to address air quality issues in areas like Southwest Detroit, where residents face higher exposure to pollutants from nearby industries and heavy truck traffic. Similarly, Chicago has seen community efforts to address air pollution in areas like the Southeast Side, where residents have fought against polluting industries and advocated for stricter regulations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The EPA is the primary federal agency responsible for environmental protection in the United States. It sets and enforces air quality standards, including the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for six criteria pollutants. The EPA also maintains the AirNow system, which provides real-time air quality data to the public. While primarily focused on public health, the CDC plays a crucial role in understanding the health impacts of air pollution. It conducts research on the relationships between air quality and various health outcomes, and provides guidance on protecting public health from environmental hazards.\n",
        "\n",
        "In response to these challenges, community-driven science initiatives have emerged. These efforts involve local residents in collecting data on air quality and other environmental factors, often using low-cost sensors and mobile monitoring techniques. This approach helps fill gaps in official monitoring networks and empowers communities to advocate for themselves. Open data is crucial for community-driven solutions in several ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Transparency: Open data allows communities to verify official reports and hold authorities accountable.\n",
        "-   Accessibility: When air quality data is freely available, communities can use it to inform local decision-making and advocacy efforts.\n",
        "-   Innovation: Open data enables researchers, activists, and tech developers to create new tools and analyses that can benefit communities.\n",
        "-   Collaboration: Open data facilitates collaboration between communities, scientists, and policymakers, leading to more effective solutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "While the EPA and CDC provide federal networks of open-access datasets like the Air Quality System (AQS), TRI, ICIS-AIR, and Population Level Analysis and Community Estimates (PLACES) collections, community driven data collection is a large part of driving change in traditionally underrepresented communities. In Chicago, the Array of Things project has installed sensors throughout the city, providing open data on various environmental factors including air quality, while Detroit's Community Air Monitoring Project uses low-cost sensors to collect and share air quality data in areas underserved by official monitoring stations.\n",
        "\n",
        "With access to open data, communities can:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Identify local air quality hotspots that may be missed by sparse official monitoring networks.\n",
        "-   Correlate air quality data with health outcomes to strengthen advocacy efforts.\n",
        "-   Develop targeted interventions, such as promoting indoor air filtration on high-pollution days.\n",
        "-   Create custom alerts and information systems tailored to local needs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although open data provides many benefits, challenges still remain. These include: 1) ensuring data quality and consistency, especially when integrating data from various sources; 2) addressing the \"digital divide\" to ensure all community members can access and use the data; 3) balancing the need for detailed local data with privacy concerns; and 4) building capacity within communities to effectively use and interpret complex environmental data.\n",

        "The Clear the Air Coalition, a new environmental justice advocacy group in Michigan, is calling for stronger protection of vulnerable communities from pollution. Launched in Detroit, the coalition argues that state regulators focus too much on technical compliance with environmental laws rather than public health.

It tracks information related to stationary sources of air pollution, including their compliance with various Clean Air Act regulations, permit data, and enforcement actions. While ICIS-AIR and the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) are separate systems, they have significant overlap in their coverage of industrial facilities and air emissions. Many facilities that report to TRI also have data in ICIS-AIR, providing complementary information.\n",

Established under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986, the TRI is a publicly accessible database maintained by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). It requires certain industrial facilities to report annually on their releases of toxic chemicals into the environment, including air emissions. The TRI provides valuable data on over 770 chemicals and chemical categories, offering insights into the types and quantities of pollutants released into the air by various industries. This information is vital to researchers, policymakers, and community advocates in assessing local air quality, identifying potential health risks, and developing targeted strategies to reduce toxic air emissions. By making this data publicly available, the TRI plays an important role in promoting transparency and supporting environmental justice initiatives focused on improving air quality in communities across the nation.\n",

EnviroFacts integrates information from multiple EPA databases, covering various aspects of environmental health, including air quality, water quality, hazardous waste, and toxic releases. One of the key components of EnviroFacts is the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) data. Through EnviroFacts, users can easily access and query TRI information, allowing them to investigate toxic chemical releases and waste management activities in their local areas. The integration of TRI data within the broader EnviroFacts system enables researchers, policymakers, and community members to contextualize toxic release information alongside other environmental indicators.\n",

The complaint, filed in 2020 by environmental groups and local residents, challenged the renewal and expansion of U.S. Ecology North's license, arguing it was unjust to increase hazardous waste storage in a predominantly low-income and minority neighborhood. As part of the settlement, EGLE will now consider environmental justice concerns in future licensing decisions for hazardous waste facilities.\n",

        "The agreement, described as \"groundbreaking\" by the Sierra Club, introduces several new measures. EGLE will conduct environmental justice and cumulative impact analyses for future licensing decisions, potentially denying licenses that would have an unlawful impact on human health and the environment. The settlement also includes provisions for improved community engagement, such as better translation services, public input processes, and the installation of air monitors around U.S. Ecology North. Additionally, the state will work with local residents to conduct a community health assessment. While some details remain to be clarified, environmental advocates view this as a significant step towards advancing environmental justice in Michigan.\n",

        "NASA's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) raster dataset, available through the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC), is a high-resolution geospatial resource that quantifies social vulnerability across the United States. This dataset is based on the CDC's Social Vulnerability Index but is presented in a raster format, providing continuous coverage at a 250-meter resolution. The SVI incorporates various socioeconomic and demographic factors such as poverty, lack of vehicle access, crowded housing, and minority status to assess communities' capacity to prepare for, respond to, and recover from hazards, including environmental threats like poor air quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "The raster format allows for more detailed spatial analysis and integration with other environmental datasets. This makes it particularly valuable for researchers and policymakers studying the intersection of social vulnerability and environmental risks, such as air pollution exposure. By overlaying this SVI data with air quality information, for instance, analysts can identify areas where socially vulnerable populations may be disproportionately affected by poor air quality, supporting environmental justice initiatives and targeted intervention strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "SEDAC, as part of NASA’s Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS), hosts this dataset along with other socioeconomic and environmental data, facilitating interdisciplinary research on human-environment interactions. The SVI raster dataset’s high resolution and comprehensive coverage make it a powerful tool for assessing environmental equity and informing policy decisions at various geographic scales.\n",

        "Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) is a spatial interpolation method used to estimate values at unknown locations based on known values at nearby points. The fundamental principle of IDW is that points closer to the location being estimated have more influence than those farther away. IDW calculates the estimated value as a weighted average of nearby known values, with weights inversely proportional to the distance between the known point and the estimation location. IDW is popular in geographic information systems (GIS) and environmental sciences due to its simplicity and effectiveness in creating continuous surfaces from point data, such as elevation, temperature, or pollution levels. While IDW has advantages like preserving local variation and working well with evenly distributed points, it also has limitations; including potential \"bull's-eye\" patterns around data points, inability to account for spatial trends or barriers, and sensitivity to outliers and clustering of input points.\n",

In contrast, Moran's I is specifically designed for spatial data and measures spatial autocorrelation – the degree to which a variable is correlated with itself across geographic space. Moran's I takes into account both the values of observations and their spatial relationships, typically using a spatial weights matrix. While Pearson's correlation can tell you if two variables are related overall, Moran's I can reveal whether high or low values of a variable tend to cluster together in space, or if they're randomly distributed.

        "A p-value, or probability value, is a statistical concept used to determine the significance of results in hypothesis testing. It represents the probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as the observed results, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. In simpler terms, it measures the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. P-values range from 0 to 1, with lower values indicating stronger evidence against the null hypothesis. Typically, a p-value below a predetermined threshold (often 0.05) is considered statistically significant, suggesting that the observed results are unlikely to have occurred by chance alone. However, it's important to note that while p-values can indicate the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis, they do not prove or disprove hypotheses, nor do they measure the size or importance of an effect. They should be interpreted in conjunction with other factors such as effect size, sample size, and practical significance.\n",

That said the correlation is lower and we can the same feature as before in that there are a large amount of 0 values that are mixed in all throughout the data. You could attempt to address this issue by using a larger resolution when creating the raster layer depicting air release sums (we used 5000m), or by including different sources of air pollution.\n"

        "This lesson provided a comprehensive exploration of four environmental and public health datasets, focusing on the Detroit metropolitan area. By analyzing data from ICIS-AIR, the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI), the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), and CDC PLACES, we gained insights into the complex relationships between industrial air pollution, social vulnerability, and health outcomes. The integration of these datasets, combined with geospatial analysis techniques, allowed us to identify areas where environmental hazards and social vulnerabilities intersect, highlighting potential environmental justice concerns. This approach demonstrates the power of combining diverse datasets and utilizing geospatial tools to inform policy decisions and target interventions in areas of greatest need.\n",
