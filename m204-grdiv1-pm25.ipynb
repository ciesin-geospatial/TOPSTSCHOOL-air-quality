        "In this lesson, you will use NASA socioeconomic and environmental Earthdata available at NASA [Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/centers/sedac-daac) (SEDAC) to examine air quality by measuring concentrations of particulate matter (PM) data in different international administrative areas. We will determine if each country meets international health guidelines, and we will compare the PM concentration between areas with different levels of socioeconomic deprivation, a proxy for poverty, to determine if there is a correlation between exposure to air pollutants and poverty.\n",

        "This lesson walks through the process of calculating and visualizing zonal statistics for a set of countries using spatial raster data, focusing on PM2.5 concentrations, Global Gridded Relative Deprivation Index (GRDI) data for each country these different socioecomnomic areas. We begins by subsetting data by country and iterating over each country to extract relevant zonal statistics like mean, median, and various percentiles forPM2.5 concentrations. These statistics are stored in a GeoDataFrame, which is later used to create a choropleth map that visualizes specific PM2.5 concentration metrics across countries. The lesson includes a detailed analysis of PM2.5 concentrations within different GRDI quartiles for selected countries. This involves clipping the raster data to each country's geometry, filtering the data based on the GRDI quartiles, and calculating the mean PM2.5 levels for each quartile. The results are then visualized using customized plots to highlight the relationship between air quality and GRDI metrics across the selected countries.\n",

        "\n",
        "As we have learned from previous lessons in this module, air quality is an important factor that if unmitigated can pose significant health risks, particularly to children’s health. In this module, we will use global particulate matter (PM) spatial data and GADM administrative boundaries to determine the average PM2.5 concentrations in each country and determine if they are meeting the[World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/)’s (WHO’s) air quality guidelines. Furthermore we will use spatial population data to normalize the air pollution concentrations per capita. We will subset 10 countries to analyze how areas with different levels of multidimensional deprivation, a proxy for poverty, compare with regards to PM2.5 concentrations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Background\n",
        "\n",
        "Air pollution is now recognized as the single biggest environmental threat to human health. Air pollution affects different aspects of health and impacts everyone in low- middle- and high-income countries alike. It is estimated that pollution is responsible for 9 million deaths per year [@fuller2022]. The burden of disease attributable to air pollution is now on a par with other major global health risks such as unhealthy diet and tobacco smoking [@who2021; @who2022]. Air pollution also places risks upon several of the United Nations’ 2023 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 3 (Good health and well-being), SDG 11 (Sustainable Communities), and SDG 15 (Life on Land), among others [@un_sdgs_2024]. Monitoring air quality is crucial for the monitoring of well being of people around the world and for the advancement of global sustainable development policies that address these environmental risks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Particulate matter (PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀) can penetrate deep into the lungs and bloodstream, causing respiratory and cardiovascular issues and are linked to conditions like heart disease and lung cancer (World Health Organization, 2022). Benefits from improved air quality include prevention of air pollution-related premature deaths, chronic diseases, damages to ecosystems and crops, as well as the economic benefits for human health from air quality improvement [@calvin2023]. The United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) latest Climate report acknowledges the largest adaptation gaps exist in projects that manage complex dynamics between air quality and climate risks, and that reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions would lead to improvements in air quality within a few years [@calvin2023]). Progress has been made to improve air quality, particularly in high-income countries, however; 99% of the world’s population is living in places where the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) air quality guidelines are not being met[@who2021; @who2022].\n",
        "\n",
        "The WHO Global Air Quality Guidelines, first introduced in 1987, recommends safe levels for six key pollutants—PM₂.₅, PM₁₀, ozone (O₃), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), sulfur dioxide (SO₂), and carbon monoxide (CO) which represent critical risks to human health globally. Recently updated guidelines respond to new scientific findings demonstrating that even lower concentrations of air pollutants than previously understood can lead to severe health impacts. Table 1 shows the latest Air Quality Guidelines (AQG) for PM2.5.\n",

        "Inequality, political instability, and increased cost of living are some of the causes preventing significant progress to reduce poverty and meet the SDGs. This continued environmental inequality can also be seen in the significant majority (89%) of premature deaths attributed to air pollution, which occur in low- and middle- income countries (World Health Organization, 2022). In an account of 110 countries, 1.1 billion people (18%) are considered to live in “acute” multidimensional poverty, with half living in Sub-Saharan Africa and a third living in South Asia (UNDP (United Nations Development Programme), 2023). Studies have shown that persons with lower socioeconomic status disproportionately experience higher concentrations of pollutants (Flanagan et al., 2019). The level of poverty experienced by vulnerable communities can compound the risks posed by pollution leading to worsening well being and health outcomes.\n",

This data can be summarized using [GADM.org](https://gadm.org/) data, which provides administrative areas of many countries. We can determine the average concentration for the entire country area; however, many areas many not be populated by people, so we will use population data to subset areas where at least one person is living. This will also be used to normalize the data to a per-capita value and provide us with a better representation of the PM2.5 concentrations that people are experiencing.\n",
        "\n",
        "once we determine the top 10 countries with the highest average per capita PM2.5 concentrations, we will use those results to further classify the data into socioeconomic strata in each country.

We employ the **Global Gridded Relative Deprivation Index (GRDI), v1 (2010 – 2020)** dataset can be downloaded from [SEDAC](https://doi.org/10.7927/3xxe-ap97) as well [@centerforinternationalearthscienceinformationnetwork-ciesin-columbiauniversity2022a].\n",
