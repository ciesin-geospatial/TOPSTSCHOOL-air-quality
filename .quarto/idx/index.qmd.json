You can learn more about the SCHOOL Project and other modules on the [SCHOOL Project home page.](https://ciesin-geospatial.github.io/TOPSTSCHOOL/)\n\nThis TOPS SCHOOL module on the theme of \"Air Quality and Health\" provides a foundational understanding of the complex interplay between air quality, public health, and environmental justice. We will explore how we can use spatial data for the study of air pollution, the sources and types of pollutants, and their impacts on vulnerable communities. You will gain critical insights into how environmental factors shape health outcomes. As you engage with the lessons, you will develop a comprehensive understanding of key concepts, including the composition of air, the significance of social vulnerability, and the tools available for analyzing environmental data. Ultimately, these lessons will empower you to contribute meaningfully to discussions and actions pertaining to air quality and environmental justice.\n\nThe following lessons examine how poor air quality impacts human health. Each lesson uses one or more datasets to walk users through accessing and analyzing data, and further adapting the code to perform their analyses including: data cleaning, processing to subset to an area of interest, and creating visualizations to share what they have learned with their communities, explore the relationships with variables such as extreme temperatures, demographic and socioeconomic factors, environmental injustice, and environmental disasters.\n\n::: {.callout-tip style=\"color: #5a7a2b;\"}\n**This module is designed to provide undergraduate students and early-career researchers with an introduction to the data science “life cycle” and sample code describing how Open Science principles can be effectively applied to earth sciences, particularly in the context of air pollution and its impact on health.**\n\nTeaching earth science topics and coding skills in depth is beyond the scope of the SCHOOL Modules. Instead, the SCHOOL Project aims to provide users with the skills to adapt the skills learned in SCHOOL lessons to the users’ own Open Science workflow.
