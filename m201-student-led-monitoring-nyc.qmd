## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you should be able to:

-   Connect to air quality sensor APIs to retrieve both real-time pollutant data and sensor metadata (e.g., location, device status).
-   Access TEMPO air quality data as a service from NASA
-   Compare air quality metrics from a wildfire event to annualized PM2.5 data for the location
-   Clean and preprocess air quality datasets, including handling missing values and formatting timestamps for analysis.
-   Create and interpret exploratory charts, such as time series plots and histograms, to visualize pollutant trends over time.
-   Calculate summary statistics (e.g., daily mean, maximum levels) and compare pollutant measurements to EPA air quality standards.
-   Explore relationships between air quality data and weather variables (e.g., wind speed, temperature) to assess environmental influences.
-   Identify and interpret anomalous pollution events using statistical methods and visual inspection of data trends.
-   Map sensor locations and pollutant concentrations to understand the spatial distribution of air quality measurements.

Urban Wildfires/Palisades, NJ Fire:

The wildfires in Palisades, New Jersey in November 2024 negatively affected air quality in New York City. Wildfire smoke, laden with fine particulate matter (PM2.5), traveled across state lines, contributing to elevated levels of air pollution in NYC. This phenomenon is consistent with broader trends observed in the U.S., where wildfire smoke has slowed or reversed progress toward cleaner air in many states. Studies have shown that PM2.5 from wildfires can embed deep into the lungs and bloodstream, leading to health issues such as asthma attacks and heart problems. The impact of these fires on NYC's air quality was compounded by local emissions, a scenario supported by research indicating that interactions between urban pollution and wildfire smoke can increase ozone and particulate matter levels.

The compounding effects of local emissions and wildfire smoke in urban areas like NYC pose substantial health risks. Research has demonstrated that wildfire smoke can carry contaminants hundreds of kilometers, leaving a toxic footprint in urban environments. This is particularly concerning as climate change is expected to increase the frequency and severity of wildfires, making them a dominant source of urban pollution. Academic studies highlight the need for new strategies to regulate air pollution from wildfires, as current policies often exempt such events as "exceptional" and do not account for their growing impact on air quality trends. In NYC, the combination of wildfire smoke and urban emissions resulted in hazardous air quality conditions, prompting health advisories and highlighting the need for more effective air quality management strategies.

Measuring and Sensing Air Quality:

Air quality significantly impacts human health, environmental conditions, and overall quality of life. Accurate and accessible air quality monitoring is essential for understanding pollutant levels and making informed decisions to improve environmental health. Pollutants such as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ozone (O₃), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), and carbon monoxide (CO) can have significant impacts on respiratory health, cardiovascular systems, and overall well-being.

​In this lesson, students will explore the fundamentals of air quality measurement using QuantAQ sensors. QuantAQ, a company specializing in air quality monitoring solutions, provides tools that combine modern computational data science with atmospheric chemistry expertise. Their sensors are designed to offer reliable, accurate measurements of multiple pollutants across various locations. ([https://blog.quant-aq.com/hello-air-quality-world](https://blog.quant-aq.com/hello-air-quality-world/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) ​ Monitoring these pollutants is essential for assessing environmental conditions, formulating public health policies, and guiding community actions.​

In this lesson, you will learn about the negative impact of the wildfire in Palisades, New Jersey in November of 2024 on air quality in the surrounding area, including New York City. Using the relevant APIs, you will learn how to download air quality data from PurpleAire and QuantAQ, and perform exploratory data analysis to understand the effects of the wildfire on air quality measures like PM2.5.

This lesson gives learners insight into the fundamentals of air quality measurement. Students will explore various pollutants, understand the tools and methods used to monitor air quality, and learn how to interpret data from different sources. By engaging with real-world data and scenarios, learners will gain insights into the importance of air quality and the measures taken to ensure a healthier environment.​

## Introduction

Pollution represents a critical threat to environmental health [@manisalidis2020; @WHO2021; @mananga2023], characterized by the introduction of harmful substances into the environment in quantities that disrupt natural processes and negatively affect living organisms and ecosystems. Among the various forms of pollution, air pollution stands out due to its widespread impact on both health and the environment. Air, primarily composed of nitrogen and oxygen, can become a vehicle for a variety of pollutants—including gases like carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, and even hazardous liquids and solids like heavy metals and plastic debris [@Nathanson2024]. These pollutants can have immediate or long-term consequences, compromising air quality, water resources, soil health, and biodiversity, which ultimately jeopardizes the well-being of both ecosystems and human populations.

### What is Air?

Air is essential to our existence, yet we often underestimate its potential to harm us through the pollutants it carries, which can negatively affect health and environmental quality. Composed primarily of about 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, air also contains trace amounts of other gases like carbon dioxide, neon, and hydrogen. Beyond gases, air is filled with tiny particles known as aerosols. These include non-living substances such as dust and soot, as well as living organisms called **bioaerosols**, which can travel long distances through wind, rain, or even a sneeze. Some of these particles fall under the category of particulate matter (PM), PM0.1 PM2.5 and PM10, which are small enough to be inhaled and can significantly impact health. While some aerosols occur naturally, others—like smoke from vehicles and power plants—contribute to air pollution (NASA, 2016).
